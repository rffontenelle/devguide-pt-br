"When you feel comfortable enough to want to help tackle issues by trying to "
"create a patch to fix an issue, you can start by looking at the `\"easy\" "
"issues`_. These issues *should* be ones where it should take no longer than "
"a day or weekend to fix. But because the \"easy\" classification is "
"typically done at triage time it can turn out to be inaccurate, so do feel "
"free to leave a comment if you think the classification no longer applies."

"For the truly adventurous looking for a challenge, you can look for issues "
"that are not considered easy and try to fix those. It must be warned, "
"though, that it is quite possible that a bug that has been left open has "
"been left into that state because of the difficulty compared to the benefit "
"of the fix. It could also still be open because no consensus has been "
"reached on how to fix the issue (although having a patch that proposes a fix "
"can turn the tides of the discussion to help bring it to a close). "
"Regardless of why the issue is open, you can also always provide useful "
"comments if you do attempt a fix, successful or not."
