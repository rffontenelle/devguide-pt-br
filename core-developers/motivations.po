msgid ""
"The `issue metrics`_ automatically collected by the CPython issue tracker "
"strongly suggest that the current core development process is bottlenecked "
"on core developer time - this is most clearly indicated in the first metrics "
"graph, which shows both the number of open issues and the number of patches "
"awaiting review growing steadily over time, despite CPython being one of the "
"most active open source projects in the world. This bottleneck then impacts "
"not only resolving open issues and applying submitted patches, but also the "
"process of identifying, nominating and mentoring new core developers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../core-developers/motivations.rst:287
msgid ""
"The core commit statistics monitored by sites like `OpenHub`_ provide a good "
"record as to *who* is currently handling the bulk of the review and "

"changes, or mentoring new contributors."

"This page aims to provide at least some of that missing data by encouraging "
"core developers to highlight professional affiliations in the following two "

"development process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../core-developers/motivations.rst:308
msgid ""
"Core developers working for organisations with a vested interest in the "
"sustainability of the CPython core development process are also encouraged "
"to seek opportunities to spend work time on mentoring potential new core "
"developers, whether through the general `core mentorship program`_, through "
"mentoring colleagues, or through more targeted efforts like Outreachy's paid "
"`internships`_ and Google's `Summer of Code`_."

"Core developers that are available for consulting or contract work on behalf "

msgstr ""

"Changes to the software and documentation maintained by core developers, "
"together with related design discussions, all take place in public venues, "
"and hence are inherently subject to full public review. Accordingly, core "
"developers are NOT required to publish their motivations and affiliations if "
"they do not choose to do so. This helps to ensure that core contribution "
"processes remain open to anyone that is in a position to sign the "
"`Contributor Licensing Agreement`_, the details of which are filed privately "
