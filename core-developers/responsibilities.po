"As contributors to the CPython project, our shared responsibility is to "
"collaborate constructively with other contributors, including core "
"developers. This responsibility covers all forms of contribution, whether "
"that's submitting patches to the implementation or documentation, reviewing "
"other peoples' patches, triaging issues on the issue tracker, or discussing "
"design and development ideas on the core :ref:`communication channels "
"<communication-channels>`."

"Core developers accept key additional responsibilities around the ongoing "
"management of the project:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../core-developers/responsibilities.rst:18
msgid ""
"core developers bear the additional responsibility of handling the "
"consequences of accepting a change into the code base or documentation. That "
"includes reverting or fixing it if it causes problems in the Buildbot fleet "
"or someone spots a problem in post-commit review, as well as helping out the "
"release manager in resolving any problems found during the pre-release "
"testing cycle. While all contributors are free to help out with this part of "
"the process, and it is most welcome when they do, the actual responsibility "
"rests with the core developer that merged the change"
msgstr ""

#: ../../core-developers/responsibilities.rst:26
msgid ""
"core developers also bear the primary responsibility for deciding when "
"changes proposed on the issue tracker should be escalated to the "
"appropriate :ref:`Discourse <communication-discourse>` category for wider "
"discussion, as well as suggesting the use of the Python Enhancement Proposal "
"process to manage the design and justification of complex changes, or "
"changes with a potentially significant impact on end users"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result of the additional responsibilities they accept, core developers "
"gain the privilege of being able to approve proposed changes, as well as "
"being able to reject them as inappropriate. Core developers are also able to "
"request that even already merged changes be escalated to :ref:`Discourse "
"<communication-discourse>` for further discussion, and potentially even "
"reverted prior to release."

"Becoming a core developer isn't a binary \"all-or-nothing\" status - CPython "
"is a large project, and different core developers accept responsibility for "
"making design and development decisions in different areas (as documented in "
"the :ref:`experts` and :ref:`developers`)."

"Submitting a `contributor form for Python`_ licenses any code you contribute "

"This is a very important step! Hopefully you have already submitted a "
"contributor agreement if you have been submitting patches. But if you have "
"not done this yet, it is best to do this ASAP, probably before you even do "
"your first commit so as to not forget. Also do not forget to enter your "
"GitHub username into your details on the issue tracker."

"Once you have your commit privileges on GitHub you will be able to accept "
"pull requests on GitHub. You should plan to continue to submit your own "
"changes through pull requests as if you weren't a core developer to benefit "
"from various things such as automatic integration testing, but you can "
"accept your own pull requests if you feel comfortable doing so."

msgid ""
"First and foremost, be a good person. This might sound melodramatic, but you "
"are now a member of the Python project and thus represent the project and "
"your fellow core developers whenever you discuss Python with anyone. We have "
"a reputation for being a very nice group of people and we would like to keep "
"it that way.  Core developers responsibilities include following the `PSF "
"Code of Conduct`_."

msgid ""
"Second, please be prompt in responding to questions. Many contributors to "
"Python are volunteers so what little free time they can dedicate to Python "
"should be spent being productive. If you have been asked to respond to an "
"issue or answer a question and you put it off it ends up stalling other "
"people's work. It is completely acceptable to say you are too busy, but you "
"need to say that instead of leaving people waiting for an answer. This also "
"applies to anything you do on the issue tracker."
msgstr ""

#: ../../core-developers/responsibilities.rst:110
msgid ""
"Third, please list what areas you want to be considered an expert in the :"
"ref:`experts`. This allows triagers to direct issues to you which involve an "
"area you are an expert in. But, as stated in the second point above, if you "
"do not have the time to answer questions promptly then please remove "
"yourself as needed from the file so that you will not be bothered in the "
"future. Once again, we all understand how life gets in the way, so no one "
"will be insulted if you remove yourself from the list."
msgstr ""

#: ../../core-developers/responsibilities.rst:118
msgid ""
"Fourth, please consider whether or not you wish to add your name to the :ref:"
"`motivations` list. Core contributor participation in the list helps the "
"wider Python community to better appreciate the perspectives currently "
"represented amongst the core development team, the Python Software "
"Foundation to better assess the sustainability of current contributions to "
"CPython core development, and also serves as a referral list for "
"organisations seeking commercial Python support from the core development "
"community."

"And finally, enjoy yourself! Contributing to open source software should be "
"fun (overall). If you find yourself no longer enjoying the work then either "
"take a break or figure out what you need to do to make it enjoyable again."
