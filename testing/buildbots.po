"To assert that there are no regressions in the :ref:`development and "
"maintenance branches <devcycle>`, Python has a set of dedicated machines "
"(called *buildbots* or *build workers*) used for continuous integration.  "
"They span a number of hardware/operating system combinations.  Furthermore, "
"each machine hosts several *builders*, one per active branch: when a new "
"change is pushed to this branch on the public `GitHub repository <https://"
"github.com/python/cpython>`_, all corresponding builders will schedule a new "
"build to be run as soon as possible."

"The Web interface for each branch at https://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/, "

"If you like IRC, having an IRC client open to the #python-dev-notifs channel "

"way to get notified that there is something you should look in to."

"A subset of the buildbots are marked \"stable\".  They are taken into "

"This does not mean that other builders' test results can be taken lightly, "

msgid ""
"Sometimes, while you have run the :ref:`whole test suite <runtests>` before "
"committing, you may witness unexpected failures on the buildbots.  One "
"source of such discrepancies is if different flags have been passed to the "
"test runner or to Python itself.  To reproduce, make sure you use the same "
"flags as the buildbots: they can be found out simply by clicking the "
"**stdio** link for the failing build's tests.  For example::"

msgid "Ordering-dependent failures"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing/buildbots.rst:125
msgid ""
"Sometimes the failure is even subtler, as it relies on the order in which "
"the tests are run.  The buildbots *randomize* test order (by using the ``-"
"r`` option to the test runner) to maximize the probability that potential "
"interferences between library modules are exercised; the downside is that it "
"can make for seemingly sporadic failures."

"The ``--randseed`` option makes it easy to reproduce the exact randomization "

"If this is enough to reproduce the failure on your setup, you can then "
"bisect the test sequence to look for the specific interference causing the "

"fromfile`` (or ``-f``) option of the test runner to run the exact sequence "
"recorded in that text file::"

"In the example sequence above, if ``test_unicode`` had failed, you would "

"And, if it succeeds, the following one instead (which, hopefully, shall "

"Then, recursively, narrow down the search until you get a single pair of "
"tests which triggers the failure.  It is very rare that such an interference "
"involves more than **two** tests.  If this is the case, we can only wish you "
"good luck!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing/buildbots.rst:197
msgid ""
"You cannot use the ``-j`` option (for parallel testing) when diagnosing "
"ordering-dependent failures.  Using ``-j`` isolates each test in a pristine "

msgstr ""

#: ../../testing/buildbots.rst:206

"While we try to make the test suite as reliable as possible, some tests do "

"Network-related tests, such as ``test_poplib``, ``test_urllibnet``, etc. "

msgid ""
"When you think a failure might be transient, it is recommended you confirm "
"by waiting for the next build.  Still, even if the failure does turn out "
"sporadic and unpredictable, the issue should be reported on the bug tracker; "
"even better if it can be diagnosed and suppressed by fixing the test's "
"implementation, or by making its parameters - such as a timeout - more "
