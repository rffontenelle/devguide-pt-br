"Python's :ref:`buildbots` system was discussed earlier.  We sometimes refer "
"to the collection of *build workers* as our \"buildbot fleet\".  The "
"machines that comprise the fleet are voluntarily contributed resources.  "
"Many are run by individual volunteers out of their own pockets and time, "
"while others are supported by corporations.  Even the corporate sponsored "
"buildbots, however, tend to exist because some individual championed them, "
"made them a reality, and is committed to maintaining them."
