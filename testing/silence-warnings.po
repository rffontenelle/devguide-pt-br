"When running Python's test suite, no warnings should result when you run it "
"under :ref:`strenuous testing conditions <strenuous_testing>` (you can "
"ignore the extra flags passed to ``test`` that cause randomness and parallel "
"execution if you want). Unfortunately new warnings are added to Python on "
"occasion which take some time to eliminate (e.g., ``ResourceWarning``). "
"Typically the easy warnings are dealt with quickly, but the more difficult "
"ones that require some thought and work do not get fixed immediately."

"If you decide to tackle a warning you have found, open an issue on the "
"`issue tracker`_ (if one has not already been opened) and say you are going "
"to try and tackle the issue, and then proceed to fix the issue."
