"The Python language has a substantial body of documentation, much of it "
"contributed by various authors. The markup used for the Python documentation "
"is `reStructuredText`_, developed by the `docutils`_ project, amended by "
"custom directives and using a toolset named `Sphinx`_ to post-process the "
"HTML output."

"Python's documentation has long been considered to be good for a free "
"programming language.  There are a number of reasons for this, the most "
"important being the early commitment of Python's creator, Guido van Rossum, "
"to providing documentation on the language and its libraries, and the "
"continuing involvement of the user community in providing assistance for "
"creating and maintaining documentation."

"Python.  More specifically, it is for people contributing to the standard "

"the Python documentation tools for topics other than Python, and less useful "
"still for authors not using the tools at all."

"existing documentation or provide documentation that's missing, the existing "
"documentation team will gladly work with you to integrate your text, dealing "
"with the markup for you. Please don't let the material in this section stand "
