"While an issue filed on the `issue tracker`_ means there is a known issue "

"documentation that needs updating for Python 3)."

"If you decide to proofread, read a section of the documentation from start "
"to finish, filing issues in the issue tracker for each major type of problem "
"you find. Simple typos don't require issues of their own, but, instead, "
"submit a pull request directly. It's best to avoid filing a single issue for "
"an entire section containing multiple problems; instead, file several issues "
"so that it is easier to break the work up for multiple people and more "
"efficient review."
