"On occasion people come up with an idea on how to change or improve Python "
"as a programming language. This document is meant to explain exactly what "
"changes have a reasonable chance of being considered and what the process is "
"to propose changes to the language."

"First and foremost, it must be understood that changes to the Python "
"programming language are difficult to make. When the language changes, "
"**every** Python programmer already in existence and all Python programmers "
"to come will end up eventually learning about the change you want to "
"propose. Books will need updating, code will be changed, and a new way to do "
"things will need to be learned. Changes to the Python programming language "
"are never taken lightly."

msgid ""
"Because of the seriousness that language changes carry, any change must be "
"beneficial to a large proportion of Python users. If the change only "
"benefits a small percentage of Python developers then the change will not be "
"made. A good way to see if your idea would work for a large portion of the "
"Python community is to ask in the `Ideas Discourse category`_. You can also "
"go through Python's stdlib and find examples of code which would benefit "
"from your proposed change (which helps communicate the usefulness of your "
"change to others). For further guidance, see :ref:`suggesting-changes`."

"Your proposed change also needs to be *Pythonic*. While only the Steering "
"Council can truly classify something as Pythonic, you can read the :pep:`Zen "
"of Python <20>` for guidance."

"The `Ideas Discourse category`_ is specifically intended for discussion of "
"new features and language changes. Please don't be disappointed if your idea "
"isn't met with universal approval: as the :pep:`long list of Withdrawn and "
"Rejected PEPs <0#abandoned-withdrawn-and-rejected-peps>` in the :pep:`PEP "
"Index <0>` attests, and as befits a reasonably mature programming language, "
"getting significant changes into Python isn't a simple task."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer-workflow/lang-changes.rst:53
msgid ""
"If the idea is reasonable, someone will suggest posting it as a feature "
"request on the `issue tracker`_, or, for larger changes, writing it up as "
"PEP following the :ref:`lang-changes-pep-process`."

"Sometimes core developers will differ in opinion, or merely be collectively "

msgid ""
"Once you are certain you have a language change proposal which will appeal "
"to the general Python community, you can begin the :abbr:`PEP (Python "
"enhancement proposal)` process to officially propose the change. See :pep:"
"`1` for information on PEPs and the PEP process, and the :pep:`PEP Index "
"<0>` for examples."

msgid ""
"If the PEP is accepted, then your proposed language change will be "
"introduced in the next release of Python. Otherwise, your PEP will be "
"recorded as rejected along with an explanation, to inform others who may "
"propose a similar language change in the future."
