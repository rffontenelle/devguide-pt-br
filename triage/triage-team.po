"The Python triage team is a group dedicated towards improving workflow "
"efficiency through thoughtful review and triage of open issues and pull "
"requests. This helps contributors receive timely feedback and enables core "
"developers to focus on reviewed items which reduces their workload. The "
"expectations of this role expand upon the \"Triager\" role on the :ref:"
"`issue tracker <tracker>`. The responsibilities listed below are primarily "
"centered around the Python GitHub repositories. This extends beyond CPython, "
"and, as needed, to other repos such as devguide and core-workflow."

"Although triagers have the power to close PRs, they should generally not do "

"All Python core developers are welcome to invite a Python contributor to the "

"When you have consistently shown the ability to properly help triage issues "
"without guidance, you may request that you be given the \"Triager\" role on "
"the :ref:`issue tracker <tracker>`. You can make the request to any core "
"developer. If they decide you are ready to gain the extra privileges on the "
"tracker they will then act as a mentor to you until you are ready to do "
"things entirely on your own. There is no set rule as to how many issues you "
"need to have helped with before or how long you have been participating. The "
"key requirements are that you show the desire to help, you are able to work "
"well with others (especially those already with the Triager role), and that "
"have a firm grasp of how to do things on the issue tracker properly on your "
"own."

"Gaining the Triager role will allow you to set any value on any issue in the "

"lessen the workload for everyone by gaining your help."

"core-workflow/issues/new?template=triage_membership.md>`_. If the core "
"devloper decides you are ready to gain the extra privileges on the tracker, "
